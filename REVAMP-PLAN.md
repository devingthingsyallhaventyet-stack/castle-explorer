# Scenic Route — Full Revamp Plan

## Vision
Transform from a routing tool with a castle database into a **discovery-first platform** for historic sites across the UK & Ireland.

## Phases

### Phase 1: Rich Site Profiles ← CURRENT
- Expand data model: history, condition, access, tags[], tips, nearbyCount
- Full profile UI (not just sidebar) — history, what you'll see, visitor info, photos, nearby sites
- Wikipedia summary scraping as baseline content

### Phase 2: Discovery Features
- 2a. Curated Collections (themed lists powered by tags)
- 2b. What's Near Me (proximity discovery)
- 2c. Regional Browsing

### Phase 3: Unified Route Builder
- Merge Trip Planner into Route Builder
- Add "Suggest Stops Along Route" feature
- Remove separate Trip Planner

### Phase 4: Navigation Restructure
- Explore | Near Me | Route Builder | My Stuff | Filters

### Phase 5: Dataset Expansion (1,000+ sites)
- English Heritage, Cadw, Historic Scotland, OPW Ireland

### Phase 6: Polish & Future
- Custom domain, SEO, Firebase auth, user contributions, sharing
